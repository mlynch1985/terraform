# AWS EC2 Instance Terraform module

Terraform module which creates EC2 instance(s) on AWS.

These types of resources are supported:

* [EC2 instance](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/instance.html)

## Terraform versions

Terraform 0.12. Pin module version to `~> v2.0`. Submit pull-requests to `master` branch.

Terraform 0.11. Pin module version to `~> v1.0`. Submit pull-requests to `terraform011` branch.

## Usage

```hcl
module "ec2_cluster" {
  source                 = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version                = "~> 2.0"

  name                   = "my-cluster"
  instance_count         = 5

  ami                    = "ami-ebd02392"
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  key_name               = "user1"
  monitoring             = true
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-12345678"]
  subnet_id              = "subnet-eddcdzz4"

  tags = {
    Terraform   = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
```

## Examples

* [Basic EC2 instance](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance/tree/master/examples/basic)
* [EC2 instance with EBS volume attachment](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance/tree/master/examples/volume-attachment)

## Make an encrypted AMI for use

This module does not support encrypted AMI's out of the box however it is easy enough for you to generate one for use

This example creates an encrypted image from the latest ubuntu 16.04 base image.


```hcl
resource "aws_ami_copy" "ubuntu-xenial-encrypted-ami" {
  name              = "ubuntu-xenial-encrypted-ami"
  description       = "An encrypted root ami based off ${data.aws_ami.ubuntu-xenial.id}"
  source_ami_id     = "${data.aws_ami.ubuntu-xenial.id}"
  source_ami_region = "eu-west-2"
  encrypted         = "true"

  tags {
    Name = "ubuntu-xenial-encrypted-ami"
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "encrypted-ami" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu-xenial-encrypted"]
  }

  owners = ["self"]
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu-xenial" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  owners      = ["099720109477"]
}
```


## Notes

* `network_interface` can't be specified together with `vpc_security_group_ids`, `associate_public_ip_address`, `subnet_id`. See [basic example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance/tree/master/examples/basic) for details. 
* Changes in `ebs_block_device` argument will be ignored. Use [aws_volume_attachment](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/volume_attachment.html) resource to attach and detach volumes from AWS EC2 instances. See [this example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-ec2-instance/tree/master/examples/volume-attachment).
* One of `subnet_id` or `subnet_ids` is required. If both are provided, the value of `subnet_id` is prepended to the value of `subnet_ids`.

| user\_data\_base64 | Can be used instead of user_data to pass base64-encoded binary data directly. Use this instead of user_data whenever the value is not a valid UTF-8 string. For example, gzip-encoded user data must be base64-encoded and passed via this argument to avoid corruption. | string | `"null"` | no |
