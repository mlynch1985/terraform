# Basic EC2 instance

Configuration in this directory creates EC2 instances with different sets of arguments (with Elastic IP, with network interface attached, with credit specifications).

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which can cost money. Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
